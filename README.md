# HumanBenchMarkHelper
A simple script I'm working on to "help" a user score a higher score in a mini game hosted on [HumanBenchMark](https://www.humanbenchmark.com/tests/verbal-memory).



## How does the minigame work?
The idea of the minigame is that a word will appear on the screen. If you believe that the word has not appeared before you click new, if you believe that the word as already appeared you click seen. If you answer 3 of these incorrectly you lose. 

## How does this script help the user?
With this python script the user can enter the word that apperars in the game, if the word has appeard before it will alert the user, which is guarenteed method to get very high scores. The only limiting factor is you're patience to keep going.
